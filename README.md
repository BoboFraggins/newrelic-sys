Rust bindings to the [New Relic C SDK].

Requirements
------------

Building this library requires all the same [requirements] as the C-SDK. This library will _not_ currently link against musl, due to a few missing symbols (at least `qsort_r` and `backtrace`) - help would be appreciated in getting that to work!

Updating
--------

The Makefile included in this repository includes a `bindings` target. This requires `bindgen` to be installed. Updating the bindings should then be a case of:

    git submodule update
    make bindings
